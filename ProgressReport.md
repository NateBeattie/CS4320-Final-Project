# Sprint 1 Progress Report:

Indication about whether or not you need to update your scope:

At this point, it seems like our scope is okay. However, once we start making changes to the code in upcoming sprints, we may find that we still need to rethink how much we will be able to do in the timeframe. For example, I forsee that we may have to really focus on one specific section of the documentation instead of the whole thing.
