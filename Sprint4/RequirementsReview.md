# Review Requirements and Use Cases against progress on code
 
 Much like last sprint, our use case was fairly simple, so I would say we have fulfilled our requirments to help ease the setup for new developers. We've used our docs as a guide for a fresh install, and have had a much easier time than when we first tried to install Augur. Additionally, as mentioned in the last sprint, we have added more links to other helpful documentation and guides for the prerequisite programs, including PostgreSQL and EC2.
