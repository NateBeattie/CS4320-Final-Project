# Final Reflections

Our final sprint went prettly smoothly, we again met on discord to discuss any revisions to the rough draft, as well as things we should add to increase clarity. 
Overall, we met our goals throughout the project, and are happy with the final documentation we created. 
If we were to continue with this project, we could transform the word document to a markdown format or rst format to be consistent with the current docs. We also would add more sections about using the backend as well as setting up and using the frontend portion, as we chose to focus on the preceding sections for this assignment.
