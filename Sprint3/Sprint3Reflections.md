# Sprint 3 Reflections

This sprint went pretty smoothly as well. We talked on discord and after our team meeting to get a better understanding of what we should do for this sprint, and then we got to work.

This time around, the augur installations was even more effortless, and we have a good idea on what information to include in our rough draft of our installation guide. We did meet our goal from last sprint, and have created a complete rough draft, so our goal for the next sprint would be to make any final edits and adjustments and then film the explanation video for the rest of the class.
