## Notes for reference

Parts:
Outline - designing what we are going to put in the final documentation. For us, its not like module 5. 
Proof of concept. 

Notes from him on canvas: 
Remember that the design needs to include a pretty thorough outline of the documentation you intend to deliver. 
Paragraph topic sentence level detail. 
Indications of where you will put graphics. 
All good ideas.
Notes from meeting:
Make a fresh install of augur, make notes of things that are painful, these become sections of handbook/document. 
	Better postgresql instructions
	Mac - install xcode?
	Docker - do not necessarily have to include 
	Take current docs, copy/paste, make notes about what should be changed. 

I think we should mainly focus on the backend part. Maybe from the beginning of the documentation to the page that says “Collecting Data”
