# Sprint 2 Reflections

This sprint went pretty smoothly as well. We talked on discord and after our team meeting to get a better understanding of what we should do for this sprint, and then we got to work. 

This time around, the augur installations went more smoothly, and we specifically took notice of things that didn't go well so we could write them down and add them to our updated documentation. We did meet our goal set from the last sprint, as we now have a good outline of where to go and how to start off sprint 3. Our goal for the next sprint is to get an understanding of how we should specifically implement our various changes on our own forks of augur, and ultimately making some of those changes.
