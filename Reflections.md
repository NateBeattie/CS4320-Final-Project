# Reflections

This Sprint went rather smoothly. After our meeting we set up another time to meet and talk via Discord. There we divided up the labor and all got our parts done.
Hopefully we can continue to work this efficiently and keep communications open.

Our inital augur backend installation seemed to work, but then we discovered it was not running properly, so we had to go back and reconfigure a couple things, but now the backend is good to go. That was mildly frustrating. Overall, we met our goals for this module, and have started off well. Our goal for the next module is to greater define our problems and what we are specifically going to implement in the coming sprints.
